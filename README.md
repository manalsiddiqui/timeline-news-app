## üîß Customization

### Changing Update Frequency

Edit the cron schedule in `server/index.js`:

cron.schedule('*/5 * * * *', async () => {
  await newsService.checkForNewNews();
});
```

### Adding New News Sources

Extend the `NewsService` class in `server/services/newsService.js` to support additional news APIs.
